            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Your Guide:</strong> This tutorial follows the teaching philosophy of Dr. Ryland Grace - a
                fictional scientist and educator from Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary." Grace is known for breaking down
                complex problems into simple, understandable steps using methodical scientific thinking and memorable
                analogies. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll benefit from this clear, systematic approach to
                learning!
            </div>

            <div class="scientist-insight">
                <strong>The Scientific Method for Learning Algorithms:</strong> "Just like in science, we'll start with
                observations, form hypotheses about how things work, test them with examples, and build understanding
                step by step. No prior knowledge assumed - just curiosity and willingness to experiment!" üßë‚Äçüî¨
            </div>

            <p>Whether you're a complete beginner or refreshing your knowledge, this tutorial will help you understand
                algorithms through interactive examples and clear explanations. We'll use practical analogies that
                anyone can relate to, regardless of their technical background.</p>

            <h2>üß™ Chapter 1: What the Heck IS an Algorithm?</h2>

            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Context:</strong> In programming, we often need to solve problems step-by-step. An algorithm is
                simply a precise recipe for solving a problem - like following directions to cook a meal, assemble
                furniture, or navigate to a destination.
            </div>

            <div class="scientist-insight">
                <strong>Scientific Insight:</strong> "An algorithm is like the scientific method, but for computers.
                Instead of discovering why plants grow toward light, you're discovering the most efficient way to find
                information or solve a problem. Both require clear, repeatable steps!" üî¨
            </div>

            <p>Listen, if scientists can figure out how to communicate with dolphins using systematic approaches, you
                can understand what an algorithm is. Ready? Here we go:</p>

            <p><strong>Algorithm (noun):</strong> A step-by-step recipe for solving a problem. Like a scientist's
                methodology - methodical, logical, and with just enough trial-and-error to keep things interesting.</p>

            <h3>üçú Real-World Example: Making Instant Ramen (The Universal Algorithm)</h3>
            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Before we jump into computer algorithms, let's see the pattern in
                something everyone knows. Making ramen follows the same logical structure as any computer algorithm:
                clear inputs, defined steps, and expected outputs.
            </div>

            <div class="interactive-demo">
                <h4>The Ramen Algorithm:</h4>
                <ol id="ramen-steps">
                    <li>Boil water (2 cups)</li>
                    <li>Add noodles to boiling water</li>
                    <li>Cook for 3 minutes</li>
                    <li>Add flavor packet</li>
                    <li>Stir and serve</li>
                    <li>Try not to burn your tongue (optional but recommended)</li>
                </ol>
                <button class="btn" onclick="demonstrateRamen()">Execute Ramen Algorithm</button>
                <div id="ramen-result"></div>
            </div>

            <p>See? Every algorithm has the same basic structure: <strong>Input</strong> (hungry human, raw
                ingredients), <strong>Process</strong> (following steps), <strong>Output</strong> (edible food,
                hopefully).</p>

            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Computer Connection:</strong> In programming, instead of making ramen, we might be sorting a
                list of names, finding the shortest route between cities, or organizing data. But the principle is
                identical: clear steps that transform input into desired output.

        <!-- Chapter 2: Linear Search -->
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>üîç Chapter 2: Linear Search - "The Systematic Investigation Method"</h2>

            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Real-World Context:</strong> Imagine you're looking for a specific book in an unsorted pile.
                You'd check each book one by one until you find it. This methodical, thorough approach is exactly how
                linear search works in programming - checking each item in sequence.
            </div>

            <div class="scientist-insight">
                <strong>Scientific Approach:</strong> "Linear search is like systematically checking every sample in a
                lab until you find the one you need. It's not the fastest method, but it's foolproof - if the item
                exists, you'll definitely find it. Sometimes the simple, reliable approach is exactly what you need!" üõ∏
            </div>

            <p>Imagine a researcher needs to find a specific sample in their lab storage. They could:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Check the first container</li>
                <li>If it's not there, check the second container</li>
                <li>Keep checking until they find it (or run out of containers)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>That's linear search! Simple, reliable, and thorough. It might not be the fastest method, but it's
                guaranteed to work.</p>

            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Programming Application:</strong> In computer science, linear search is used when you need to
                find a specific value in a list, array, or database. Examples: finding a customer by name, locating a
                file on your computer, or checking if a username already exists.

            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Real-World Context:</strong> Imagine you're comparing different methods to organize a library.
                Some methods work great for 100 books but become impossible with 10,000 books. Big O notation helps us
                predict how algorithms will perform as the amount of data grows - like predicting how long different
                organizing methods will take with larger libraries.
            </div>

            <div class="scientist-insight">
                <strong>Scientific Perspective:</strong> "Big O notation is like predicting how long an experiment will
                take based on the number of samples. O(1) means 'always takes the same time regardless of sample size' -
                like reading one specific value. O(n) means 'time increases proportionally' - like counting every item.
                It's about scalability!" ‚òï
            </div>

            <p>Big O notation tells us how an algorithm's performance changes as the input gets bigger. Think of it as a
                way of saying "How long will this take if I have to process a thousand items instead of ten?"</p>

            <div class="context-box">
                <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Understanding efficiency helps you choose the right approach for your
